## Streams in node
In a nutshell from the [Docu](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_events):
> Much of the Node.js core API is built around an idiomatic asynchronous **event-driven** architecture in which certain kinds of objects (called "emitters") emit named events that cause Function objects ("listeners") to be called.


the code contains example regarding the usage of the emitters and the eventEmitter Class


## Resources:
the code follows the [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_event_emitter.htm) examples
